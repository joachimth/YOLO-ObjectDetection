# Example Configuration File for YOLO Object Detection
# Copy this file to config.yaml and modify as needed
# Usage: python main.py (automatically loads config.yaml if it exists)
#        python main.py --config custom.yaml (loads custom config file)

# Model Configuration

# Detection Parameters
confidence_threshold: 0.5  # Minimum confidence for detections (0.0-1.0)
                           # Lower = more detections (more false positives)
                           # Higher = fewer detections (higher precision)
                           # Recommended: 0.3-0.5 for general use, 0.6-0.8 for high precision

# Video Source
video_source: 0  # Camera index (0, 1, 2...) or video file path
                 # 0 = default webcam
                 # 1 = second camera
                 # "video.mp4" = video file
                 # "rtsp://..." = IP camera stream

# Visualization Settings
box_color: [0, 255, 0]  # BGR color for bounding boxes
                        # [0, 255, 0] = Green (default)
                        # [0, 0, 255] = Red
                        # [255, 0, 0] = Blue
                        # [0, 255, 255] = Yellow
                        # [255, 0, 255] = Magenta
box_thickness: 2        # Thickness of bounding box lines (1-5 recommended)
font_scale: 0.6         # Scale of text labels (0.3-1.0 recommended)
font_thickness: 2       # Thickness of text (1-3 recommended)

# Feature Flags
enable_tracking: false  # Enable object tracking between frames (assigns IDs to objects)
